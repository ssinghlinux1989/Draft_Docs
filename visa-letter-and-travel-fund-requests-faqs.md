# Visa Letter and Travel Fund Requests FAQs

### What is a Visa Letter?

The Linux Foundation provides a formal written document that you submit to a consulate or embassy requesting a visa for your travel purposes. The letter typically includes information about the purpose of the trip, the duration of the stay, and proof of financial support.

### Does a visa letter guarantee that I will get a visa?

No, a visa letter does not guarantee that you will get a visa. The decision to grant a visa is made by the consulate or embassy based on various factors. The visa letter simply provides additional information to support your visa application.

### Can I request a Visa letter on someone else's behalf?

Yes, you need to submit the application with their information, including their LF account username. They can only see the application status in their **Individual Dashboard** and you will not be able to see the status on their behalf.
