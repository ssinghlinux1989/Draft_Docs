# Trends

Trends dashboards provide analytics of project performance, ecosystem and data source related metrics, including analytics related to growth of member organizations, events, webinars, contributors, number of commits, total number of code backlogs, issues, and many more for a project. These performance-related data are grouped into different blocks of [_metrics_](broken-reference).
