# Commits

The **Commits** metric refers to the quantification and analysis of code commits made by contributors within a specified timeframe. A code commit represents a unit of change to the software's source code repository.

Each commit includes the following:

* Commits Authored: These are the number of commits where the author of the commit is the selected user. The number is a hyperlink, and on click, it opens a modal that shows the LOC ++ (added) and LOC -- (deleted).
* Commits Co-Authored: These are the number of commits where the user has been a co-author.

### Why is this metric important?

The metric enables project maintainers and stakeholders to gain valuable insights into code changes and progress within a specified period.

* It provides insights into the volume and frequency of code changes made by contributors. By visualizing commit data in a bar chart, you can track the progress of development efforts over time.
* Changes in commit counts provide periods of intense development, periods of slower activity, or the impact of specific events or milestones on the project.

### Interact with the chart

The bar chart on the dashboard represents the analysis, displaying the number of commits over time. Hover over a specific bar to access the detailed commit information for that particular month within the selected period.

The interactive download feature (Icon ) enables you to download the chart in CSV and PNG file formats.
