# Contributors Metric

The data visualization on the overview page shows real-time data on the total number of contributors across all monitored repositories during the selected time period.

Contributors can include individuals who actively participate in the development of the project and perform one or many activities:

* `issue-comment`
* `issues-closed`
* `issues-opened`
* `pull_request-closed`
* `pull_request-comment`
* `pull_request-merged`
* `pull_request-opened`
* `pull_request-review-thread-comment`
* `pull_request-reviewed`
* `committed-commit`
* `co-authored-commit`
* `authored-commit`

### Why is this important?

When you want to see the health of your open source project, the **Contributor Chart** is a crucial project performance indicator.

* Visualizing the number of contributors over time makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and overall community interest. The trend helps project maintainers and other stakeholders act based on the charts.
* Tracking the number of contributors can provide insights into the health and vitality of your project.
* By analyzing changes in the contributor count, project managers can gain insights into the effectiveness of their community outreach and development strategies.
