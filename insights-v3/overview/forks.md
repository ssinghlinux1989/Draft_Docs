# Forks

A fork refers to the creation of a new, distributed copy of a software project or repository. When a user or organization creates a fork, they create a separate copy of the original codebase that they can modify, experiment with, and develop independently from the original project.

Forks are widely used in open-source software because the developers can modify an existing project's functionality without affecting the original codebase. Once changes have been made to a forked repository, developers can create a pull request to merge their changes back into the original project.

When you fork a repository on GitHub, you create a separate copy of the original repository that you can work on independently. This copy includes all of the files, branches, and commit history of the original repository.
